# Football Predictor

In anticipation of Euro 2024, this is a statistical analysis of all international football results. The aim of this project os to correctly predict the score of every football match in the tournament, and hence the winner of Euro 2024. 
I am taking all games that have occured between two teams, and finding the average score. Is this a valid statistic to base a prediction on? Yes.
So what if it doesn't take into consideration team quality over time, everything regresses to the mean eventually right?
